Muskan EveryThing is Woking in code.
There is problem with your pip.
It can be fixed by uninstalling python and installing fresh python which i cant do because of it admin password so i developed code in my laptop.
After re-instalation,copy Mansoor_final.py in py charm,then in bottom left open terminal and type pip install pymongo (or call me whenever you install) .
Then Just run the program.
